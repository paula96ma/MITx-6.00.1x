#Problem 1
#10.0/10.0 points (graded)
#Assume s is a string of lower case characters.
#Write a program that counts up the number of vowels contained in the string s. Valid vowels are: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'. For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', your program should print:
#Number of vowels: 5

#Method I
#We use strings only.
#v is a string that represents the valid vowels:
v='aeiou'
count=0
for char in s: # We take out every character in the given strings 
    if char in v:  # and now we check out if it is in our valid vowels
        count+=1   #we add 1 every time the string is a valid vowel
print("Number of vowels: "+ str(count))

#Method II
#We use a list instead of a string 

v=["a","e","i","o","u"]
count=0
for char in s: 
    if char in v: 
        count+=1  
print("Number of vowels: "+ str(count))
