# Problem 2
# 10.0/10.0 points (graded)
# Assume s is a string of lower case characters.
# Write a program that prints the number of times the string 'bob' occurs in s. For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', then your program should print
# Number of times bob occurs is: 2

count=0
w="bob" 
for i in range(len(s)): # i is an index of every character
    if s[i:i+3]==w:    # with every iteration, we slice the string and compare it to the main character ("bob")
        count+=1
print("Number of times bob occurs is: "+ str(count))
